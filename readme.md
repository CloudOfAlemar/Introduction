#Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is Alejandro Martinez. My goal is to become a frontend
web developer to, someday, be a part of an amazing team and build awesome
projects or web applications.

##Interests
I'm interested in figuring out how to effectively apply the coding languages I'm learning so
that I can be a productive part of a team.

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript by creating projects and components from
online resources such as Frontend Mentor. I'm also learning how to use Git and Github
so that I can publish my code online and soon be able to work on projects with others
who love to code.
